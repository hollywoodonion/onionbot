<h1><strong>Welcome to Onion Bot!</strong></h1>
<p>This is the start of something special. Something that will change the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Why was Onion Bot Created?</h1>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/romandrunk/">RomanDrunk</a> initially created his own bot with limited AI functionality and was bragging about it to the fellow chums at our social hang out #1. I said I would make my own bot to compete with his, thus a gentlemans wager was initiated with me having 24hours to complete it. I was done in 2 hours with plenty of time to spare for an online marketing campaign. Thus, the bitter rivalry between myself and Roman was born. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What can Onion Bot Do?</h1>
<p>It's far easier to list what Onion Bot cannot do. But if you must know, here is the cliffs notes..</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Onion Bot can jump, repeatedly</strong>: Roman Bot is good at jumping maybe once a map.</li>
  <li><strong>Onion Bot can turn right like nobodies business: </strong>Right turns are a piece of cake for this sophisticated AI platform.</li>
  <li><strong>From dark to light: </strong>Onion Bot has a 10,000,000 lumen flashlight that can instantly blind NewGuy and all his cronies. </li>
  <li><span class="red"><strong>NEW IN V2.13</strong></span> <strong>Hostile Mode Initiated: </strong>Onion Bot isn't just all show, it has teeth to. Cycle through all weapons and fire constantly, without hesitation. Roman Bot won't see what hit him. Literally.</li>
</ul>
